I don't prepare the potato ahead of time because sometimes it will oxidize and turn red and it makes for an ugly pizza.Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake it for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is brown and the cheese as melty and shimmering.Wait a little to slice and serve. | Serve it hot.I feel obliged to remind you about the other two balls of dough, but once you devour the first one I guarantee you'll be searching for the others.
